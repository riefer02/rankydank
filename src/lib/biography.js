  "The Lewd Dudes are the #1 hottest alternative rock band formed in Austin, Texas in 2017 by Andrew Riefenstahl (Producer + Guitar), Riley Sklar (Bass), Rankin Fetzer (Guitar), Scott Morgan (Keys), and Jordan Hughes (Drums).",
  "The Lewd Dudes label of party rock is a misnomer. Over the course of five years, they've changed. What started out as feel-good hooks and comical lyrics has become something entirely different. This ensemble has matured like aging wine.",
  "Latest Album: Pulling inspiration from their experiences and the collapse of live music during the pandemic, Habitable Zone sets you on a colossal interplanetary exploration of the human condition, self-reflection, mortality, failed relationships, over indulgance, bliss, and the hope for a new beginning.",

collapse of live music during the pandemic, Habitable Zone (latest release) will set

over indulgence, enjoying the little things, and the hope for a new beginning. Climb into the 
capsule and blast off with The Lewd Dudes on this mystifying and awe inspiring journey 
across time and space. Habitable Zone was produced by The Lewd Dudes, recorded at our
