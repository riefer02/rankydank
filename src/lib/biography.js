  "Rankydank (Rankin Fetzer) is a musician/Youtuber originally from Houston Texas, currently based in Austin, TX. He is known mostly for live-looping electric guitar, vocals, bass, keys, and electronic drums, through a Boss RC-505 loop-station. This allows him to create (often improvised) funky, dance, intimate, and energetic live performances.",
  "Rankydank's tunes call inspiration from bands and artists such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Marc Rebillet, Jimi Hendrix, Parliament Funkadelic, Dua Lipa, Pretty Lights, and the Beatles, along with many other artists from the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s, and 20s.",
  "Though he has one full-length EP out currently across all streaming platforms(self-titled Rankydank), which is a mostly acoustic set of songs, most of his fans view his work through his live-performance video content available on Youtube.",
  "Currently, Rankydank is working on his 2nd album, consisting of only Live-looping tracks, as well as putting out content daily/weekly on Youtube/Instagram/TikTok and playing live shows in Austin and surrounding cities/states.",
